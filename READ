14 Physics Engine Simulator
Write a simulator for physics, like a game may have. Create virtual objects and apply forces
and constraints to them, such as gravity, friction, and collision detection, and initial vector
of motion. Generate a visual representation of the system and simulate the movement of
the objects according to the applied forces and constraints.



Code will focus on RIGID BODY PHYSICS. 

Call certain simulation - prompts to show what kind of simulation the user wants  ( Do you want to add slopes? y/n : ) or ( Load : slopes, Field, Hills : ) 

User inputs;
prompt:
-number of objects, properties of these objects ( scale, position, elasticity(TBD) ) -> Randomise properties? 
-forces ,  ( Apply force - xN in direction ( x* , y* , z* ) ,( center of mass or point on surface? ) ) 

-trigger, ( the start button, program will continue until user will tell it to stop ( No Pause button) )
Condition:
-No interactions ffrom user while the code is running ( MAYBE CLICKS?)



Output;
- Visual window ( objects rendered in its projection)
- No statistics (Starting Position, Final position) 



what we need to code;
-collision detection, 
          software just detects whether the object was in contact. (Decides when to apply force between 2 objects)
-collision response,
          what is being called by collision detection. 
-Rigid Body functions, 
          handling (mass, position, linear velocity, rotational velocity),  impulse (change in momentum) 
          handling geometry and how to determine the interaction between them. 
          

-GUI ,
           How to render the elements in conduction. 
           

-data types and data handling. 
           classes and what is required, structures and vectors to store information. 
           e.g. Rigid body class that cube and sphere class can inherit from. 
                Associated classes that contain the code on how to alter these values.
