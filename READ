14 Physics Engine Simulator
Write a simulator for physics, like a game may have. Create virtual objects and apply forces
and constraints to them, such as gravity, friction, and collision detection, and initial vector
of motion. Generate a visual representation of the system and simulate the movement of
the objects according to the applied forces and constraints.



Code will focus on RIGID BODY PHYSICS. 

Call certain simulation - prompts to show what kind of simulation the user wants  ( Do you want to add slopes? y/n : ) or ( Load : slopes, Field, Hills : ) 

User inputs;
prompt:
-number of objects, properties of these objects ( scale, position, elasticity(TBD) ) -> Randomise properties? 
-forces ,  ( Apply force - xN in direction ( x* , y* , z* ) ,( center of mass or point on surface? ) ) 

-trigger, ( the start button, program will continue until user will tell it to stop ( No Pause button) )
Condition:
-No interactions ffrom user while the code is running ( MAYBE CLICKS?)



Output;
- Visual window ( objects rendered in its projection)
- No statistics (Starting Position, Final position) 




collision detection, software just detects whether the object was in contact. 
                     (Decides when to apply force between 2 objects)
