14 Physics Engine Simulator
Write a simulator for physics, like a game may have. Create virtual objects and apply forces
and constraints to them, such as gravity, friction, and collision detection, and initial vector
of motion. Generate a visual representation of the system and simulate the movement of
the objects according to the applied forces and constraints.
